# rig-liveness-watchdog — deterministic per-rig agent + merge-freshness watchdog.
#
# Catches the failure where a critical rig agent (refinery / witness) silently
# dies, or the refinery stalls with a REAL merge backlog, with NO alert. This is
# a plain exec order (no LLM, no agent, no wisp) precisely BECAUSE the Witness
# LLM patrol loop is the thing that silently dies — a deterministic shell tick
# survives where an agent loop does not.
#
# RIG SCOPING. The controller fans every exec order out once per scope (the HQ /
# global scope plus one scope per rig) and stamps $GC_RIG with the scope's rig
# name — empty for the HQ/global scope. The sibling store/exec env builder
# (gascity internal/orders/env.go reserves GC_RIG; cmd/gc/store_target_exec.go
# sets env["GC_RIG"]=target.RigName per scope). So this script checks ONLY the
# single rig named in $GC_RIG and does NOT loop every rig itself. The bare
# global scope (GC_RIG empty) is a no-op — it exits immediately so the per-rig
# fan-out is the single source of one-invocation-per-rig, with no global
# duplicate racing the per-rig runs. The ledger filename includes the rig name
# so concurrent rig scopes never write the same file.
#
# For the rig it is invoked for it checks:
#
#   1. The rig's `refinery` and `witness` sessions are alive. A session is
#      DEAD when it is missing entirely or its state is one of the hard-dead
#      states (crashed / creating / failed-create / closed). `asleep`,
#      `active`, `awake`, `running` are all ALIVE (an idle refinery sleeps).
#
#   1b. Witness heartbeat freshness. A witness in an ALIVE state can still have
#      a silently-dead self-scheduled patrol loop — it just sits `asleep`
#      forever. The chronic real failure (patrol stalls of 14h-63h, all while
#      "asleep"/"active") is invisible to the dead-state check above. So we also
#      treat an ALIVE witness whose last-active heartbeat is older than
#      $WATCHDOG_WITNESS_STALE_MIN minutes as STALLED. A healthy witness sleeps
#      ~60s between patrol cycles, so >15 min of silence means the loop is dead.
#
#   2. Refinery health: a refinery in a hard-dead state (crashed / creating /
#      failed-create / closed / missing) is ALWAYS an incident, regardless of
#      queue depth — a crashed refinery is never normal.
#
#   2b. Merge-stall, gated on a REAL routed-bead backlog. An idle/asleep
#      refinery on a quiet dev rig is normal: low-activity rigs legitimately
#      leave beads assigned to a sleeping refinery for hours with no merge. That
#      is NOT a stall. We raise a merge-stall ONLY when the refinery's routed
#      merge queue holds at least $WATCHDOG_MIN_QUEUE genuinely-ready beads AND
#      no merge has landed on the default branch inside $WATCHDOG_FRESH_MIN
#      minutes. Freshness is measured against origin/<default> (the real merge
#      target) when a remote-tracking ref exists, falling back to the local ref.
#      Counting local feature branches is DELIBERATELY NOT a backlog signal:
#      stale/abandoned/squash-merged branches accumulate forever on dev rigs and
#      `git --no-contains` cannot see squash-merges, so branch-counting produced
#      chronic phantom backlogs (an idle rig with a queue of 1 but 16 dead local
#      branches was wrongly flagged as stalled). The routed-bead queue is the
#      authoritative pressure signal; unmerged-branch count is evidence only.
#
# On any detected dead-agent or stall it mails a LOUD [INCIDENT] escalation to
# $WATCHDOG_ESCALATE_TO (default: mayor) with concrete evidence. A JSON ledger
# de-dups two ways: (a) a hard wall-clock cooldown — a given (rig, incident-type)
# re-alerts at most once per $WATCHDOG_COOLDOWN_MIN minutes, mirroring the
# per-key cooldown in nudge-on-mail.sh; (b) within the cooldown the symptom is
# silently re-counted, never re-mailed, so a persistent incident does not spam.
#
# Config (all env-overridable, upstream-friendly defaults):
#   WATCHDOG_ESCALATE_TO   recipient for incident mail        (default: mayor)
#   WATCHDOG_FRESH_MIN     merge-freshness window, minutes    (default: 60)
#   WATCHDOG_COOLDOWN_MIN  min minutes between re-alerts of the same
#                          (rig, incident-type)               (default: 45)
#   WATCHDOG_WITNESS_STALE_MIN witness heartbeat staleness, minutes (default: 15)
#   WATCHDOG_STARTUP_GRACE_MIN how long a transient 'creating' / startup state is
#                          tolerated before it counts as dead  (default: 10)
#   WATCHDOG_MIN_QUEUE     minimum routed merge-queue depth to call a merge-stall
#                          (default: 2) — below this, an idle refinery is treated
#                          as quiet, not stalled. The dead/crashed-refinery
#                          escalation is UNGATED by this threshold.
