# Gas City Pack Source Map

This repo owns the external pack catalog and pack implementations. The important
split is city runtime config, active pack imports, resolved pack locks, pack
registry catalogs, future `gc init` defaults, and build/install source
selection.

This copy lives in the `gascity-packs` default workspace. It is the best
starting point when checking what has landed in the pack fork and what the
registry advertises.

## City Runtime

File: `/data/projects/doltlite-gascity/city.toml`

This controls the city itself:

- beads backend, currently `doltlite`
- rig imports
- role imports
- local pack roots such as `gascity-packs/gstack`,
  `gascity-packs/gascity-jj-base`, and related packs

This is not the pack registry. It tells this city what rigs, roles, and backend
to use.

## Active City Pack Imports

File: `/data/projects/doltlite-gascity/pack.toml`

This is the active pack import file for this city. This is what matters for the
current local city.

The important imports are:

- `bd`: `/data/projects/doltlite-gascity/gascity/examples/bd`
- `core`: `/data/projects/doltlite-gascity/gascity/internal/bootstrap/packs/core`
- `beads-doltlite`: `https://github.com/duncan4123/gascity-packs/tree/main/beads-doltlite`
- `beads-doltlite-init`: `https://github.com/duncan4123/gascity-packs/tree/main/beads-doltlite-init`

So for this city, the `beads-doltlite` pack has already been pointed at the
`gascity-packs` fork main branch.

## Resolved Pack Lock

File: `/data/projects/doltlite-gascity/packs.lock`

This records what remote imports resolved to. It has pinned commits for imports
such as:

- `beads-doltlite`
- `beads-doltlite-init`
- `gascity/roles`
- `pr-pipeline`

This is resolved install state. Edit the import source first, then let the lock
update from that source.

## Pack Registry Catalog

Primary file:

- `/data/projects/doltlite-gascity/gascity-packs/registry.toml`

Workspace copies that may also exist:

- `/data/projects/doltlite-gascity/gascity-packs-land-beads-doltlite/registry.toml`
- `/data/projects/doltlite-gascity/gascity-packs/.jjw/workspaces/beads-doltlite-publish/registry.toml`

The `gascity-packs/registry.toml` file is the registry catalog in the
`gascity-packs` fork. The landing and publish paths are JJ workspaces and are
not active city config unless the city points at them.

## Future `gc init` Defaults

These are inside the `gascity` source tree:

- `/data/projects/doltlite-gascity/gascity/cmd/gc/cmd_init.go`
- `/data/projects/doltlite-gascity/gascity/cmd/gc/embed_builtin_packs.go`
- `/data/projects/doltlite-gascity/gascity/cmd/gc/beads_backend.go`
- `/data/projects/doltlite-gascity/gascity/internal/builtinpacks/registry.go`
- `/data/projects/doltlite-gascity/gascity/internal/config/public_packs.go`

`internal/config/public_packs.go` is the main file for external public pack
defaults. If this file points at an old publish branch, future `gc init` output
can differ from the current local `pack.toml`.

## Build And Install Source Selection

The `beads-doltlite` pack build script controls where `gc`, `bd`, and
`doltlite-client` get built from.

Relevant file:

- `/data/projects/doltlite-gascity/gascity-packs/beads-doltlite/commands/build/run.sh`

That script has its own source resolution:

- prefers local `$CITY_ROOT/gascity`
- prefers local `$CITY_ROOT/beads-doltlite`
- otherwise fetches remotes
- default gascity remote: `https://github.com/duncan4123/gascity.git`, ref
  `pr-doltlite-foundation`
- default beads remote: `https://github.com/duncan4123/beads-doltlite.git`, ref
  `beads-doltlite`
- DoltLite lib can come from downloaded release state or local build dirs

This is separate from `pack.toml`.

## Current Mismatches To Clean Up

- The active city `pack.toml` points `beads-doltlite` to `gascity-packs` fork
  main.
- Future `gc init` defaults in `gascity/internal/config/public_packs.go` may
  still point at an older publish branch unless updated.
- The build script can pick local `$CITY_ROOT/beads-doltlite`. In this city
  that checkout is not the DoltLite-capable one.
- The DoltLite-capable city-local checkout appears to be
  `/data/projects/doltlite-gascity/beads-doltlite-ci`.

## Cleanup Target

Keep these in agreement:

- root `pack.toml`
- `gascity/internal/config/public_packs.go`
- `gascity-packs/registry.toml`
- the `beads-doltlite` build script source defaults and overrides

For normal local installs, build `bd` from the DoltLite-capable city-local
source, not from the stale `$CITY_ROOT/beads-doltlite` checkout.
