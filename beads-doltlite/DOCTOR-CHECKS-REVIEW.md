# Beads DoltLite Doctor Check Review

This note anchors the doctor-check work for bead `gc-eyyi`. Any follow-up
bead that references this work should link back to this file plus the source
references below, so the implementer starts from the actual integration code
instead of a generic pack checklist.

## What Was Reviewed

- Gas City pack doctor checks are executable scripts loaded from pack doctor
  declarations. The script protocol is exit `0` for OK, exit `1` for warning,
  exit `2` or other non-zero for error. The first stdout line is the message;
  later lines are details. Scripts receive `GC_CITY_PATH` and `GC_PACK_DIR`.
- This builtin pack source currently has one pack-local doctor check under
  `doctor/check-sqlite3`. A runtime/imported `gascity-packs` copy has more
  DoltLite checks, but that tree is not the source of truth for this bead. Work
  in this rig should update the builtin pack source here.
- This builtin pack exposes operational commands under `commands/`: `build`,
  `client`, `flatten`, `gc`, and `health`.
- The pack `build` command is responsible for building DoltLite-linked `gc`,
  `bd`, and the debug client with `CGO_ENABLED=1`, libsqlite3/libdoltlite
  link flags, install targets, and build-detail JSON.
- Gas City's `gc bd` store bridge switches to DoltLite by reading
  `.beads/metadata.json` or `GC_BEADS_BACKEND` / `BEADS_BACKEND`, then sets
  `GC_BEADS_BACKEND=doltlite` and `BEADS_BACKEND=doltlite` for bd operations.
- The beads source opens DoltLite only in CGO builds. Non-CGO builds return a
  clear `doltlite requires a CGO build` error.
- The DoltLite README documents that libdoltlite installs a CLI, headers, a
  static library, and shared libraries, and that Go integration uses
  `mattn/go-sqlite3` with the `libsqlite3` build tag and CGO link flags.

## Builtin-Pack Audit Question

Before adding more checks, audit whether `beads-doltlite` still needs to be a
builtin pack.

Initial answer from the current code review: keep it builtin for now, but
record exactly which responsibilities force that. The pack is part of the
bootstrap story for DoltLite-backed Gas City installs because it carries the
`build` command that produces DoltLite-linked `gc` and `bd` binaries, the
maintenance commands used by DoltLite health/maintenance orders, and the
pack-local doctor entrypoint that `gc doctor` can discover during builtin pack
materialization. That is stronger than a normal optional workflow pack.

The source pack now owns the minimum operational doctor coverage for a
DoltLite-backed city: metadata contract validation, bounded store-health
execution, read-path smoke testing, `gc`/libdoltlite link verification, and
sqlite3 availability. Deeper storage checks still belong in `bd doctor` or the
DoltLite library itself, but Gas City doctor should no longer pass when the
active backend metadata is malformed or the doltlite store cannot be opened.

Reasons it may need to stay builtin:

- It participates in bootstrapping the active beads backend for a city.
- It installs/builds `gc`, `bd`, and DoltLite-linked binaries that may be
  needed before external pack import is reliable.
- It provides doctor checks for runtime materialization and `gc bd` behavior.

Reasons it may not need to stay builtin:

- If the only remaining responsibilities are optional maintenance commands and
  documentation, a normal imported pack may be sufficient.
- If Gas City can reliably import and materialize this pack before any
  DoltLite-backed bead operation, builtin status may be unnecessary.
- If `gc bd` no longer depends on this pack's assets to operate, the pack can
  potentially be externalized.

Core order note: core still ships generic maintenance orders such as
`jsonl-export` and `reaper`. Those scripts are Dolt-server-specific and must
honor `.beads/metadata.json` before treating leftover `.beads/dolt` directories
as proof of a live Dolt target. DoltLite cities should run the
`doltlite-health` and `doltlite-maintenance` orders instead.

The audit should identify which startup/install/doctor paths truly require
builtin availability and which can move to normal pack import later.

## How Gas City Doctor Checks Run

Gas City discovers pack doctor checks from pack metadata and conventional
`doctor/<name>/run.sh` files. Each discovered check becomes a `PackScriptCheck`.
The check script runs with its working directory set to the pack directory and
receives `GC_CITY_PATH` plus `GC_PACK_DIR`. A script can also declare a fix
script through `doctor.toml`; `gc doctor --fix` runs that fix script with the
same environment contract.

Pack doctor output is intentionally simple:

- exit `0`: OK
- exit `1`: warning
- exit `2` or any other non-zero: error
- first stdout line: short result message
- remaining non-empty stdout lines: verbose details

This means new `beads-doltlite` checks should be small shell scripts under
`doctor/<check-name>/run.sh` with optional `doctor.toml` metadata. They should
not require changes to Gas City's core doctor implementation unless the pack
doctor protocol itself is insufficient.

## How The Beads DoltLite Pack Works

The builtin pack is embedded from `examples/beads-doltlite/embed.go`. Its
`PackFS` includes `pack.toml`, `doctor`, `commands`, `formulas`, `orders`, and
`assets`. The pack imports and exports the `bd` pack, so regular beads
operations still flow through the `bd` provider wrapper. The DoltLite pack adds
DoltLite-specific operational surfaces:

- `commands/build`: builds DoltLite-linked `gc`, `bd`, and debug client
  binaries using `CGO_ENABLED=1`, `libsqlite3`, and `libdoltlite`.
- `commands/health`: runs a bd-backed health/status probe with
  `BEADS_BACKEND=doltlite` and `GC_BEADS_BACKEND=doltlite`.
- `commands/flatten`: runs `bd flatten --force --json`.
- `commands/gc`: runs `bd gc --force --json`.
- `commands/client`: runs the DoltLite debug client built by the pack.

Gas City's `gc bd` bridge detects DoltLite mode by checking
`GC_BEADS_BACKEND`, `BEADS_BACKEND`, or `.beads/metadata.json` with
`backend = "doltlite"` or `database = "doltlite"`. In DoltLite mode it sets
`GC_BEADS_BACKEND=doltlite` and `BEADS_BACKEND=doltlite` for bd operations
instead of configuring a managed Dolt SQL server.

The beads source code has a separate backend open path: in CGO builds,
`OpenBestAvailable` opens `internal/storage/doltlite` when config says
DoltLite. In non-CGO builds, DoltLite returns a clear error because DoltLite
requires CGO.

## Doctor Check Inventory

These checks should remain pack-local. If a check needs Gas City state, the
pack script should inspect it through supported runtime environment or CLI
output rather than moving logic into unrelated Gas City core doctor code.

- Pack materialization: verify this builtin pack is active, `GC_PACK_DIR`
  points at a readable pack checkout, and the active pack contains expected
  command and doctor directories.
- Backend metadata: verify the active `.beads/metadata.json` selects
  `backend = "doltlite"` when the city expects the DoltLite backend, and that
  identity fields such as `database`, `dolt_database`, and `project_id` remain
  non-empty strings.
- `gc bd` bridge: verify `gc bd` operations run with
  `GC_BEADS_BACKEND=doltlite` / `BEADS_BACKEND=doltlite` and do not fall back
  to an unrelated global bd database.
- Binary availability: verify `gc`, `bd`, `sqlite3`, and `doltlite` or
  libdoltlite artifacts are discoverable using documented pack discovery rules.
- Linked build details: verify the build command wrote usable build-detail JSON
  for `gc` and `bd`, including tags, CGO state, libdoltlite path, binary path,
  and checksum.
- Linked binary sanity: verify linked `gc` and `bd` report `CGO_ENABLED=1` via
  `go version -m` where available, and warn when the check cannot be performed
  on the platform.
- DoltLite library layout: verify libdoltlite shared/static library and headers
  are present in the configured or discovered build/install location.
- Safe read smoke: run a read-only bd status/list style check against the active
  DoltLite store and report actionable errors.
- Store health smoke: run a bounded `bd status --json` with
  `BEADS_BACKEND=doltlite` and fail when the command reports an error or cannot
  open the store within the timeout.
- Optional write smoke: provide an opt-in disposable-scope write/read/update
  smoke check so routine doctor runs do not mutate production work.
- Maintenance safety: warn before `flatten` or `VACUUM` style maintenance runs
  while the city is not quiesced or active writers are present.
- SQLite/DoltLite pragmas: report WAL/busy-timeout or equivalent state where it
  is inspectable, and warn when the active build path cannot prove lock
  behavior.
- Direct-write contract: report whether direct table writes are expected to be
  versioned and durable; point to the chosen single-writer path when raw writes
  are unsafe.
- Cross-platform behavior: guard Linux/macOS-specific probes and emit
  unsupported warnings instead of failing mysteriously on other systems.
- Remediation text: every warning/error should include a concrete command or
  source reference suitable for a fresh Gas City install.

## Bead Authoring Rule

Any new bead created from this review should include links to:

- this file,
- [../../../doltlite/README.md](../../../doltlite/README.md),
- [pack.toml](pack.toml),
- [commands/](commands/),
- [doctor/](doctor/), and
- [../../../beads-doltlite/README.md](../../../beads-doltlite/README.md).

Do not sling doctor-check work until the implementer has reviewed these
references, the current pack-local doctor scripts, and the actual DoltLite
integration code paths listed above.
