Resolve `<source-anchor-id>` using the same rules as `prepare-worktree`. For a
synthetic drain-unit convoy, the source anchor is the original drain member in
`gc.drain_member_id`, not the synthetic convoy id. Read `work_dir` from the source anchor, never read `work_dir` from the synthetic drain-unit convoy,
validate that it is an absolute existing git worktree, set `WORKTREE` to that
path, then `cd "$WORKTREE"` before reading or editing source files. If
`work_dir` is missing, invalid, or points at the launcher checkout, fail this step before editing.

Do not edit files in the launcher checkout. Implement only the owned source
anchor boundary, run sandboxed verification from inside the worktree, and make a
focused commit in the worktree. Leave the source anchor open for
`close-source-anchor`; close only this implementation step when done.
