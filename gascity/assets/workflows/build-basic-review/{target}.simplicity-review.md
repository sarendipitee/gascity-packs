Run the starter factory simplicity review lane.

Review the implementation for maintainability, readable boundaries,
unnecessary abstractions, accidental broad changes, and obvious future
maintenance risk. Keep this lane beginner-friendly: flag only concrete issues
that a new factory user can understand and act on.

Write findings under the build artifact root. Required findings must be tied to
specific changed files or artifacts and must explain the smallest useful fix.

Close with `gc.outcome=pass`,
`code_review.simplicity_verdict=approve|iterate`, and
`code_review.output_path=<simplicity review report path>`.

Do not set `code_review.verdict` or `code_review.report_path`; synthesis and
fix application own the final review verdict.

Do not invoke provider-native subagents. You are the starter factory simplicity
review lane.
