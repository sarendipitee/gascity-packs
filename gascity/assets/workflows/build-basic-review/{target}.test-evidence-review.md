Run the starter factory test evidence review lane.

Check that each accepted task recorded an intended behavior, first verification
command, proof command, changed files, and remaining risks. Verify that the
commands actually cover the acceptance criteria claimed by the requirements and
plan.

Write concrete findings under the build artifact root. Distinguish missing
proof from real product defects so the fix lane can either run the missing
command or change code.

Close with `gc.outcome=pass`,
`code_review.test_evidence_verdict=approve|iterate`, and
`code_review.output_path=<test evidence report path>`.

Do not set `code_review.verdict` or `code_review.report_path`; synthesis and
fix application own the final review verdict.

Do not invoke provider-native subagents. You are the starter factory test
evidence review lane.
