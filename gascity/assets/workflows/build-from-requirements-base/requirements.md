This is the `build-from-requirements-base` requirements stage.

Produce or reuse the requirements artifact at `{{requirements_path}}` when
provided; otherwise write the default requirements artifact under
`{{artifact_root}}`.

The requirements artifact must use the base requirements contract, stable IDs,
example mapping, acceptance criteria, open questions, out-of-scope notes, and
approval state. Close only after the requirements path and content hash are
recorded for the inherited plan suffix.
