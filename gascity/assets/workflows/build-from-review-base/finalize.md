This is the `build-from-review-base` finalize stage.

Synthesize the continuation result from the prerequisite artifacts,
implementation evidence, review reports, fix attempts, drift checks, and
publish intent.

The final report must state which continuation entrypoint started the run and
which upstream stages were skipped because their approved artifacts already
existed. Include the requirements path, plan path, plan-review path when
available, decomposition path, implementation convoy ID when available,
implementation evidence, review verdict, remaining risk, publish
authorization, and next action.

Do not close the workflow root with `gc.outcome=pass` when the review verdict
is `blocked` or `changes_required`, any implementation drain failed, required
implementation evidence is missing, or `gc.build.repair_status` is anything
other than `not_needed` or `approved`. In those cases, write a final report with
`status: blocked`, record `gc.outcome=fail`, `gc.build.status=blocked`,
`gc.failure_class` with the machine-readable reason, and preserve restart
metadata such as `gc.restart.entrypoint`, `gc.restart.reason`, and the relevant
artifact paths.

Only record a passing terminal outcome when all prerequisite artifacts exist,
implementation evidence is present, review is approved, and repair status is
`not_needed` or `approved`.

Record terminal outcome metadata on the workflow root before closing so the
publish step can safely no-op, push, open a PR, or block with an explicit
reason without changing the workflow outcome.
