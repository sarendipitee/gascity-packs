# Base Formula Requirements

Schema: `gc.base-formulas.requirements.v1`

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Status | Pilot |
| Scope | Formula behavior for the Gas City build methodology base pack |
| Parent ledger | `../REQUIREMENTS.md` |

This ledger covers every formula in the base pack. The rows are grouped by
methodology contract, default implementation, implementation utilities, review
and fix utilities, GitHub adapters, and publication helpers.

## Purpose

The formula files are the executable architecture for the build methodology
base pack. Each row below names the user-visible or pack-author-visible
behavior that must remain true when the formula graph, vars, routing,
expansion, drain semantics, or step assets change.

## How To Reconcile

For every formula change:

1. Update the row for the changed formula.
2. Update `../REQUIREMENTS.md` when the change affects the base methodology
   contract or derived pack compatibility.
3. Update tests when a formula is added, removed, promoted to catalog, or
   changes stage IDs, selector vars, drain policy, or publication behavior.
4. Keep upstream toolkit-specific behavior out of this base ledger unless it is
   a generic compatibility rule for all implementations.

## Vocabulary

- **Virtual contract** - An internal base formula that defines behavior and
  artifact shape for external methodology packs to override.
- **Concrete default** - A runnable formula in this pack that implements the
  virtual contract without requiring a third-party toolkit.
- **Adapter** - A formula that owns external state such as GitHub snapshots,
  sticky comments, or PR publication while delegating planning/review stages to
  methodology formulas.
- **Selector variable** - A formula variable naming another methodology formula
  to invoke from a base or adapter workflow.

## Global Invariants

- Every formula uses `contract = "graph.v2"`.
- No formula declares reserved runtime vars `issue`, `bead_id`, or `convoy_id`.
- Cataloged formulas are user-runnable; internal/base/helper formulas are not
  cataloged unless deliberately promoted.
- Methodology packs override behavior through formula extension, expansion, or
  selector variables, not by preserving raw provider-native subagent dispatch.
- Targeted implementation formulas consume the core graph target. Targetless
  report and adapter formulas take explicit vars.
- Report formulas write durable report artifacts; adapters own external
  comment/publication lifecycle.
- `build-base`, `build-basic`, `build-from-*-base`, `build-from-*`, and
  concrete derived top-level build formulas declare formal
  `[metadata.gc.methodology]` compatibility metadata.
- Planning, decomposition, implementation, review, fix, and publish formulas
  preserve `interaction_mode` and `review_mode` semantics defined by
  `../REQUIREMENTS.md`.
- Artifact-producing formulas invoke the shared base artifact validator through
  explicit formula check steps and route failed validation back for bounded
  schema repair.
- Formula checks validate against base-owned schemas and preserve neutral
  `workflow`, `methodology`, and `producer` artifact metadata.
- Structured repeatable worker or reviewer behavior is expressed as formulas,
  expansions, drains, or fanout/fanin lanes; small local rubrics may remain in
  prompt assets.
- `build-basic` owns stable path-shadow override files for its major prompt
  pieces, including exactly one override file per default review lane.

## User Stories

### GC-BF-US-001: Author A Methodology Pack

As a methodology pack author, I want each base formula to state what it owns, so
I can decide which stages to extend, expand, or leave inherited.

Acceptance criteria:

- Every formula has a row in this ledger.
- Rows classify the launch shape and required behavior.
- Rows distinguish virtual contracts from concrete defaults and adapters.

### GC-BF-US-002: Review Formula Graph Changes

As a maintainer, I want formula requirements beside the formula files, so I can
review graph changes against behavior rather than inspecting TOML in isolation.

Acceptance criteria:

- Formula rows cite tests or formula files as evidence.
- Tests fail when formula coverage drifts.

## Technical Stories

### GC-BF-TS-001: Enforce Formula Ledger Coverage

As the test suite, I need a formula coverage guard so a new formula cannot be
added without a requirements row.

Proof expectation: `test_base_formula_requirements_cover_formula_set` checks
this ledger against the `FORMULAS` constant and formula directory.

## Behavior Requirements

| ID | Trace | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GC-BF-BR-001 | GC-BF-TS-001 | WHEN a formula exists in `gascity/formulas`, THE formula ledger SHALL contain a row naming that formula. |
| GC-BF-BR-002 | GC-BF-US-001 | WHEN a formula is a virtual methodology contract, THE row SHALL name the stage or utility contract that derived packs may override. |
| GC-BF-BR-003 | GC-BF-US-001 | WHEN a formula is a concrete default, THE row SHALL name how it implements or extends the virtual contract. |
| GC-BF-BR-004 | GC-BF-US-002 | WHEN a formula owns external side effects, THE row SHALL name the gate or authorization behavior. |
| GC-BF-BR-005 | GC-BF-US-001 | WHEN a formula participates in the full build lifecycle, THE row SHALL preserve the artifact, approval-state, traceability, mode, and drift contracts in `../REQUIREMENTS.md`. |
| GC-BF-BR-006 | GC-BF-US-001 | WHEN a formula represents repeatable fanout/fanin, retry, approval, or resumable behavior, THE row SHALL describe it as durable Gas City graph behavior rather than provider-native subagent behavior. |
| GC-BF-BR-007 | GC-BF-US-001 | WHEN a top-level build formula is added or changed, THE formula SHALL declare methodology compatibility metadata or the row SHALL document why the formula is not a top-level build formula. |
| GC-BF-BR-008 | GC-BF-US-002 | WHEN an adapter delegates to selected methodology formulas, THE row SHALL name selector pass-through, compatibility validation, and blocked-mode behavior. |
| GC-BF-BR-009 | GC-BF-US-001 | WHEN a `build-basic` prompt asset is a major user customization point, THE formula row SHALL preserve its stable path-shadow override contract. |
| GC-BF-BR-010 | GC-BF-US-002 | WHEN a formula produces a base artifact, THE formula SHALL invoke shared artifact validation for the expected schema and path. |
| GC-BF-BR-011 | GC-BF-US-002 | WHEN shared artifact validation fails, THE formula graph SHALL route back to the producer for bounded repair or stop as `blocked` after finite attempts. |
| GC-BF-BR-012 | GC-BF-US-002 | WHEN formula output includes traceability, THE formula SHALL preserve YAML coverage as the machine-readable source and mirrored markdown coverage for humans. |

## Maintenance Rules

- Add or update exactly one `GC-BF-*` row when a formula is added, removed, or
  behaviorally changed.
- Keep rows phrased as behavior contracts: graph shape, launch shape, artifacts,
  side effects, stage selectors, drain semantics, and extension expectations.
- Do not let external toolkit-specific behavior into this base ledger unless it
  becomes a shared requirement for all methodology implementations.
